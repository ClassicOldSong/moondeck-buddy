# MoonDeck Buddy ![Status](https://github.com/FrogTheFrog/moondeck-buddy/actions/workflows/publish.yaml/badge.svg)

A server-side part of the [MoonDeck](https://github.com/FrogTheFrog/moondeck) plugin for the SteamDeck.

The main goal is to have reliable information about Steam state:
 * is Steam running or not;
 * what Steam game is running and whether the game we want is updating or not;
   * **note:** Non-Steam games are not supported.

Additionally, it allows to:
 * launch a Steam game;
 * close the Steam process;
 * shutdown, restart or suspend the PC.

## How to install it?

See the [wiki](https://github.com/FrogTheFrog/moondeck-buddy/wiki) page for installation steps and other information!
